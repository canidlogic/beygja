=head1 NAME

Beygja::Util - Beygja utility functions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Beygja::VerbCode qw(dimToVerbCode);
  
  # Convert a DIM tag to a verb code and order number
  my ($verb_code, $order_number) = dimToVerbCode("GM-BH-ST2");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides various utility functions.  See the function documentation for
details.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item B<dimToVerbCode(str)>

Parse an inflection tag from the DIM data into a Beygja verb inflection
code and an order number.

Returns two values.  The first is the Beygja verb inflection code as a
string and the second is the order number as an integer.  If the
conversion fails, C<undef> is returned for both values.

See the C<VerbInflections.md> documentation file for details about how
the Beygja verb inflection codes work.

DIM data allows for a decimal integer suffix at the end of the
inflection code to indicate variants.  If there is no decimal integer
suffix, the default order number of 1 will be returned.  Otherwise, the
returned order number will match the decimal integer suffix.

If you are bulk converting, you should put a cache in front of this
function.

# Mapping of DIM elements within the inflection tags to the equivalent
# Beygja verb inflection codes.
#
# All DIM elements used for verbs should be keys in the this map.
# However, note that the mapping is not one-to-one!  Sometimes multiple
# DIM elements map to the same Beygja value, sometimes a single DIM
# element maps to more than one Beygja value (indicated by a string
# value with more than one character), and sometimes a single DIM
# element maps to no Beygja values (indicated by an empty string value).
