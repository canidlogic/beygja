=head1 NAME

beygja_iclass.pl - Generate subrange for inflections of a specific word
class.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ./beygja_iclass.pl data.csv 0 so > subrange.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scan records in a Beygja-format CSV file and compile a subrange that
only includes words of a specified word class.

The first parameter is the path to a CSV file to scan.  The
C<Beygja::CSV> parser will be used to read through it.  This script will
work on any CSV where the word class textual code is stored in the third
field.

The second parameter is the number of lines to skip at the start of the
file (if there are header lines), or zero if there are no header lines.

The third parameter is the word class abbreviated textual code, which
must be a sequence of one to eight lowercase US-ASCII letters.

The generated subrange will be in a format that can be fed into the
C<sublines.pl> script to generate another file containing only records
with the matching word class.

The process may take a long time.  Regular progress reports are issued
to standard error.
