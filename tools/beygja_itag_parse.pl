=head1 NAME

beygja_itag_parse.pl - Analyze all component elements of a list of
inflection tags.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ./beygja_itag_parse.pl < input.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input is a UTF-8 text file, LF or CR+LF line breaks, Byte Order Mark
(BOM) optional at start of first line.  Each line is either blank or
contains a single inflectional tag, possibly surrounded on either side
by tabs and spaces.

For each encountered tag, this script first of all drops any decimal
integer suffix from the end of the tag.  The tag must not be empty after
dropping the decimal integer suffix.

Then, this script parses the tag into one or more elements, where
elements are separated from each other by hyphens.

Each unique element (case sensitive) is stored, and then a list is
printed of all unique elements in sorted order.
