=head1 NAME

sublines.pl - Derive a text file from a subset of lines from another.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ./sublines.pl source.txt < subset.txt > target.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameter is the path to an existing text file in UTF-8 format with
either LF or CR+LF line breaks.  On standard input, the script reads a
sequence of instructions indicating which lines of the input file to
output.  On standard output, the selected subset of lines of the source
file is written.

The subset file read on standard input has one instruction per line,
with blank lines consisting just of tabs and whitespaces ignored.  The
instruction format is like this:

  542 16

The first decimal integer is the line number at which a range begins,
while the second decimal integer is the number of lines in that range.
At least one tab or space character must separate the two decimal
integers.  The first line in the source file is line 1.

Ranges must be ordered such that each range begins with a higher line
number than the previous, and there is no overlap between ranges.
