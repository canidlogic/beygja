=head1 NAME

echolines.pl - Echo a subset of lines from a text file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ./echolines.pl text.file 5
  ./echolines.pl text.file 1024 16

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Opens a text file at the path given in the first parameter.  The text
file must be UTF-8, with either LF or CR+LF line breaks.  Byte Order
Mark (BOM) is optional at the start of the first line, and skipped if it
is present.

After the text file is opened, this script skips to the line number
given as the second parameter.  Line 1 is the first line, so the second
parameter must be one or greater.  If the given line is not in range of
the text file, an error occurs.

Starting at the line given in the second parameter, this script outputs
either just that line (if no third parameter is given), or the number of
lines given in the third parameter if there is a third parameter.  The
third parameter must be one or greater.  At least one line will be
output, but less than the requested number may be output if the file
runs out of lines.

This script is useful for examining gigantic text files that are too
large open in a text editor.
